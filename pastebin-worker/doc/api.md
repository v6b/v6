# API Reference

## GET `/`

Return the index page.

## **GET** `/<name>[.<ext>]` or `/<name>/<filename>[.<ext>]`

Fetch the paste with name `<name>`. By default, it will return the raw content of the paste.

The `Content-Type` header is set to `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`. If `<ext>` is given, the worker will infer mime-type from `<ext>` and change `Content-Type`. This method accepts the following query string parameters:

The `Content-Disposition` header is set to `inline` by default. But can be overriden by `?a` query string. If the paste is uploaded with filename, or `<filename>` is set in given request URL, `Content-Disposition` is appended with `filename*` indicating the filename (with `<ext>` if it exists).

- `?a=`: optional. Set `Content-Disposition` to `attachment` if present.

- `?lang=<lang>`: optional. Returns a web page with syntax highlight powered by prism.js.

- `?mime=<mime>`: optional. Specify the mime-type, suppressing the effect of `<ext>`. No effect if `lang` is specified (in which case the mime-type is always `text/html`).

Examples: `GET /abcd?lang=js`, `GET /abcd?mime=application/json`.

If error occurs, the worker returns status code different from `200`:

- `404`: the paste of given name is not found.
- `500`: unexpected exception. You may report this to the author to give it a fix.

Usage example:

```shell
$ curl https://shz.al/i-p-
https://web.archive.org/web/20210328091143/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5phCQP7i-JpSvzPEMGk56Q

image/png;charset=UTF-8
```

## GET `/<name>:<passwd>`

```

## **POST** `/`

Upload your paste. It accept parameters in form-data:

- `c`: mandatory. The **content** of your paste, text of binary. It should be no larger than 10 MB. The `filename` in its `Content-Disposition` will be present when fetching the paste.

- `e`: optional. The **expiration** time of the paste. After this period of time, the paste is permanently deleted. It should be an integer or a float point number suffixed with an optional unit (seconds by default). Supported units: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days), `M` (months). For example, `360.24` means 360.25 seconds; `25d` is interpreted as 25 days. It should be no smaller than 60 seconds due to the limitation of Cloudflare KV storage.

- `s`: optional. The **password** which allows you to modify and delete the paste. If not specified, the worker will generate a random string as password.

- `n`: optional. The customized **name** of your paste. If not specified, the worker will generate a random string (4 characters by default) as the name. You need to prefix the name with `~` when fetching the paste of customized name. The name is at least 3 characters long, consisting of alphabet, digits and characters in `+_-[]*$=@,;/`.

- `p`: optional. The flag of **private mode**. If specified to any value, the name of the paste is as long as 24 characters. No effect if `n` is used.

`POST` method returns a JSON string by default, if no error occurs, for example:

```json
{
    "url": "https://shz.al/abcd",
    "admin": "https://shz.al/abcd:w2eHqyZGc@CQzWLN=BiJiQxZ",
    "expire": 100,
    "isPrivate": false
}
```

Explanation of the fields:

- `url`: String. The URL to fetch the paste. When using a customized name, it looks like `https//shz.al/~myname`.
- `suggestUrl`: String or null. The URL that may carry filename or URL redirection.
- `admin`: String. The URL to update and delete the paste, which is `url` suffixed by `~` and the password.
- `expire`: String or null. The expiration seconds.
- `isPrivate`: Bool. Whether the paste is in private mode.

If error occurs, the worker returns status code different from `200`:

- `400`: your request is in bad format.
- `409`: the name is already used.
- `413`: the content is too large.
- `500`: unexpected exception. You may report this to the author to give it a fix.

Usage example:

```shell
$ curl -Fc="kawaii" -Fe=300 -Fn=hitagi https://shz.al  # uploading some text
{
  "url": "https://shz.al/~hitagi",
  "admin": "https://shz.al/~hitagi:22@-OJWcTOH2jprTJWYadmDv",
  "isPrivate": false,
  "expire": 300
}

$ curl -Fc=@panty.jpg -Fn=panty -Fs=12345678 https://shz.al   # uploading a file
{
  "url": "https://shz.al/~panty",
  "admin": "https://shz.al/~panty:12345678",
  "isPrivate": false
}

# because `curl` takes some characters as filed separator, the fields should be
# quoted by double-quotes if the field contains semicolon or comma
$ curl -Fc=@panty.jpg -Fn='"hi/hello;g,ood"' -Fs=12345678 https://shz.al
{
  "url": "https://shz.al/~hi/hello;g,ood",
  "admin": "https://shz.al/~hi/hello;g,ood:QJhMKh5WR6z36QRAAn5Q5GZh",
